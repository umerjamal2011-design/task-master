- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue-Green (oklch(0.85 0.08 200)) for backgrounds and Neutral Gray (oklch(0.75 0.02 200)) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 50)) for completion states and important CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Pure White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0.02 200)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
