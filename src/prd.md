# TaskFlow - Enhanced Task Management App

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: TaskFlow is a comprehensive task management application that enables users to organize their work hierarchically and temporally, with support for nested sub-tasks and intelligent daily scheduling.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can efficiently break down complex projects into manageable sub-tasks
- Daily scheduling helps users maintain focus and structure throughout their day
- Hierarchical organization provides clarity on project dependencies and progress
- Time-based views help users manage both scheduled and flexible tasks

**Experience Qualities**: Organized, Intuitive, Focused

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application - Advanced functionality with hierarchical data structures, temporal scheduling, and multiple view modes

**Primary User Activity**: Creating, Organizing, and Managing - Users actively create and manage complex task hierarchies with temporal constraints

## Essential Features

### Hierarchical Task Structure
- **Unlimited sub-task nesting**: Users can create sub-tasks within sub-tasks to any depth level
- **Visual hierarchy indication**: Indentation and dot indicators show task depth and relationships
- **Expandable/collapsible views**: Users can focus on specific levels of detail
- **Dot system**: Visual dots on the left indicate subtask hierarchy levels (• for level 1, •• for level 2, etc.)
- **Cascade completion**: Option to mark parent tasks complete when all sub-tasks are done

### Advanced Scheduling System
- **Date scheduling**: Assign tasks to specific dates
- **Time scheduling**: Set specific times for focused work
- **Priority levels**: High, medium, and low priority indicators
- **Flexible vs. timed tasks**: Support both scheduled and "anytime" tasks

### Dual View System
- **Category View**: Traditional organization by project/category with hierarchical display
- **Daily View**: Time-focused view showing today's scheduled tasks, separated by timed and untimed
- **Date navigation**: Easy switching between different days

### Task Management Features
- **In-place editing**: Click to edit task titles and descriptions
- **Drag and drop**: (Future enhancement) Reorder tasks and change hierarchy
- **Quick task creation**: Streamlined process for adding both main tasks and sub-tasks
- **Rich task metadata**: Due dates, times, priorities, descriptions, and categories
- **Dark mode support**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable use in any lighting
- **Theme customization**: Category colors extend to all related UI elements for visual consistency

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Users should feel organized, in control, and focused
- **Design Personality**: Clean, professional, and systematically organized
- **Visual Metaphors**: Hierarchical indentation similar to file systems, calendar-like daily views
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced interface - clean enough to avoid clutter, rich enough to show complex hierarchies

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Adaptive monochromatic with strategic accents (supports both light and dark modes)
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#4F46E5) - represents focus and organization
- **Secondary Colors**: Adaptive grays that change based on theme for optimal contrast
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange (#F59E0B) - for completion states and highlights
- **Color Psychology**: Blue promotes focus and productivity, orange provides warmth and achievement satisfaction
- **Theme Flexibility**: Full dark mode support with carefully calibrated colors for comfortable night-time use

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between task levels, categories, and metadata
- **Font Personality**: Clean, modern, highly legible for extended reading
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing creates visual rhythm

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Primary tasks stand out, sub-tasks are visually nested, scheduled items have time indicators
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing prevents cognitive overload with complex hierarchies
- **Grid System**: Consistent alignment and spacing create order
- **Content Density**: Balanced - detailed enough to be useful, clean enough to reduce stress

### Component Design
- **Expandable Cards**: Task cards that can show/hide sub-tasks with smooth animations
- **Time Badges**: Clear visual indicators for scheduled times and dates
- **Priority Indicators**: Subtle color coding that doesn't overwhelm
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual completion rates and status tracking
- **Nested Interaction**: Intuitive controls for creating and managing hierarchies
- **Hierarchy Dots**: Small colored dots indicate subtask depth levels visually
- **Theme Toggle**: Accessible dark/light mode switching in the header
- **Category Theming**: All UI elements adapt to category colors for visual cohesion

### Animations & Interactions
- **Expand/Collapse**: Smooth animations when showing/hiding sub-tasks
- **Progress Updates**: Satisfying completion animations
- **View Transitions**: Seamless switching between category and daily views
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover states and button feedback

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Structure
- Tasks with optional `parentId` for hierarchical relationships
- Separate tracking of scheduled vs. unscheduled tasks
- Efficient filtering and sorting for daily views

### Performance
- Lazy loading for deeply nested hierarchies
- Efficient re-rendering when task hierarchies change
- Optimized date-based filtering

### User Experience
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Intuitive drag-and-drop (future enhancement)
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go task management

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with persistent storage
- **UI Components**: Shadcn components for consistency
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Icons**: Phosphor Icons for clear, consistent iconography

## Success Metrics
- Task completion rates improve with hierarchical breakdown
- Users successfully schedule and complete daily tasks
- Average session time indicates engaged, productive use
- User retention through improved organization and time management
